name  "Wen Cheese for Anson"
type  fedex

proposal  "Jumping catfish, how did you come to hear about that?  My children found something out playing.  It's just an old scrap.  Not worth a thing, friend, but if you want it you can have it.  Just do me a favor, first.  I'm always here working, and never get away.  I want a bit of special cheese I heard tell about.  I can't send family, either, cause those old enough have to help out here in the shop.  Would you do that errand, friend?"

declined  "Didn't really think you would."

accepted  "Somewhere in Wen there's a gal as makes some special cheese."

reminder   "Weren't you going to find me some special cheese from Wen?"

completed  "Well, now, this is going to be a fine treat.  I'll surprise the family.  Here's the scrap of scabbard you wanted."
