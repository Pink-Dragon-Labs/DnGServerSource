proposal  "It's a mercy he didn't break his head.  The way he launches himself into a room I'm surprised he has any whole elf parts left in his body.  I want to try a new potion on him.  I just heard of it.  Somebody in Kurz came up with it.  Would you be willing to go fetch some for me?"

declined  "Poor Ygior.  Perhaps I'll take him some fendril."

accepted  "That will be a kindness, friend."

reminder   "Go seek in Kurz for a new pain potion."

completed  "Excellent.  Just let me repackage a bit for Ygior and you'll be on your way with his pain potion."
