proposal  "That I have, and you're interested in it, I take it.  Well, I'm sure we can work something out.  For example, I have the fabric and you want it. I want something from Murias, and you could go get it.  What about a trade?  Are you interested?"

declined  "You don't even know what I want, yet."

accepted  "Good.  I want a cotton plant.  Don't tell anybody.  People in Kurz wouldn't understand.  But I want to try and grow a cotton plant here.  They grow cotton around Murias, so you should be able to get one for me there."

reminder   "Shhhh.  Get me a cotton plant from Murias."

completed  "You really did it!  Here's the embroidered fabric.  Now don't tell anyone on your way out of town.  Please."
