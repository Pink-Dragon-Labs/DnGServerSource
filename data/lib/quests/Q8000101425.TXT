type  fedex

proposal  "Indeed I do.  Just take a whiff from this container.  My customers who love coffee insist these are the very best.  Even those who do not like coffee enjoy this aroma.  You're here for a sack of these beans, I take it.  I'll pack them up, but I would like to ask a favor of you. I'll give you the beans in exchange.  Would you go to my cousin, Fenia, and fetch some lavender she has for me?"  

declined  "It's not really that far."

accepted  "She is quite a gardener, my cousin, and she dried some of her lavender for me."

reminder   "Fenia is also the local healer, and she has some dried lavender for me."

completed  "The lavender aroma is as pleasant as the vanilla beans, isn't it?  Thanks, friend, and here are the coffee beans."
