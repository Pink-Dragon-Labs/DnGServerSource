name  "The Embroidered Peacock"
type  fedex

proposal  "Friend, it's an odd coincidence, but I just received this talisman!  Would you believe it?  I didn't even know it existed, to tell the truth, but my brother collected many interesting things for me in his travels, and this talisman was among them.  I looked it up in my annals because the talisman has a little black pig on it.  Do you know the background?  This talisman was struck to commemorate a small black pig that was very swift and clever.  Isn't that curious?  I will trade it to you, friend, if you will go to Drune for me.  What about it?"

declined  "Too bad."

accepted  "I'm so glad.  I want an embroidered shawl I heard about, with a peacock on it."

reminder   "Look in Drune for an embroidered shawl with a peacock."

completed  "Lovely.  Thank you very much.  And here is that cute little talisman."
