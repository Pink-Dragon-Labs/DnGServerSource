proposal  "Zounds!  Do I hear correctly?  You want a Banshee Relic, and you seek in Wards of War.  You come to MY shop of magic!  I do NOT deal is such items!  I do not care to deal in such items!  It is an insult that you come to me!  Ahem.  However, since you are a stranger and do not know these things, I will help you.  As a special favor to you . . . note what I say, a favor . . . I know where I can procure this item.  I will get it for you if you will also do a favor for me.  It's a small thing, really.  Just go to Asgard and get my key. Will you do this small chore?"  

declined  "Then you will NOT find the Banshee Relic.  Do you hear me?  Never!"

accepted  "My key is in Asgard with a shopkeeper there."

reminder   "Go to Asgard and get my key from a shopkeeper."

completed  "So you have my key.  I'm amazed that I agreed to let the Banshee Relic go for such a small task.  But, as I did, here it is."
