proposal  "Sure thing.  I've got one tucked away.  I was going to give it to my Aunt Lireen.  She likes embroidered things.  She's got a ton of them though, so if you want it, OK by me.  I'd really like to have a fossil rock.  I hear there are lots in the desert, but I've never been there and who knows when I'll save enough to travel.  Would you fetch me a fossil rock in exchange for the scarf?"

declined  "Maybe I'll give it to my aunt after all."

accepted  "Rare!  Hurry off, friend."

reminder   "Find me a fossil rock from the desert."

completed  "Now that is an amazing sight.  This little thing lived millions of years ago.  I'm happy to trade the scarf."
