name  "Image of Duach"
type  fedex

proposal  "A wizard.  Now that's an interesting idea.  I've never carved a wizard.  Say, I'd like to try my hand at one.  In fact, I will do it.  If I carve it for you, friend, will you go to Kurz for me?"

declined  "Might just do a wizard anyway.  Interesting idea."

accepted  "I don't like going there.  Dangerous place.  But if you'll go, I would like to have an image of the god Duach.  I heard there are a few in Kurz." 

reminder   "You're going to find me an image of the god Duach in Kurz."

completed  "Thank you, friend.  I appreciate this errand.  I finished your wizard carving, too.  Turned out rather well, I thought."
