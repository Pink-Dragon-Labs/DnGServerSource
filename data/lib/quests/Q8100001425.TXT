proposal  "Good, I'm glad somebody is looking for it. It came to me through a strange circumstance and I do not think it is a proper item for casual adornment.

declined  "Then it will stay with me."

accepted  "That is satisfactory.  The favor I ask is that you fetch me an elven broach in the shape of birch leaves.  Seek in Caer Fandry." 

reminder   "Seek an elven broach of birch leaves in Caer Fandry."

completed  "Very satisfactory.  Take the Sash and treat it with honor and respect."
