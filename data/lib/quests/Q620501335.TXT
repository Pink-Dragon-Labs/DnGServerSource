proposal  "Well, it's about time.  I was afraid that Bidosk meant to leave me holding the bag.  I wasn't any too sure about dealing with elves, especially dark elves.  Our contract said I get paid after delivery is made, so the sooner you take it the better.  Will you deliver the order to Caer Fandry?" 

declined  "Now what will I do?"

accepted  "Good.  Make delivery as soon as possible, so I'll get paid."

reminder   "Take that special order back to Bidosk in Caer Fandry."
