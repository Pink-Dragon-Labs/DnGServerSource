quest  81000-01-430      # Bidosk, Pretty Nice Clothing, Caer Fandry, dark elf, 6607

name  "Thread for Bidosk"
type  fedex

proposal  "I'm glad somebody wants it.  It isn't just the image a dark elf would want as adornment, if you know what I mean.  I'll be glad to get rid of it, although I do require a favor in return.  I need a supply of thread, and it's ordered from a shop in Leinster.  Will you go get it?"

declined  "Well, then, do you want to buy something?  Let me know."

accepted  "Fine.  You'll have to find it yourself, because I've mislaid the name of the shop."

reminder   "Look through Leinster and find the shop with my thread order."

completed  "That wasn't too difficult, was it?  Here's the broach."

getItem   qThread
reward   qElvenBroach
