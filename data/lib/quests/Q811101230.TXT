type  fedex

proposal  "So you're here for Jaqqar's ring, are you.  And of course he didn't send anything to redeem it.  Trade's been a bit slow of late.  If you want to make a couple of purchases it would recompense my time.  Up to you though.  If I hand it over, you'll return the ring, I suppose?"

declined  "Hmph.  What happened to your helpfulness?"  

accepted  "Here you go, the ring of Jaqqar's old man.  Got himself murdered, did you know that?  If you want to buy anything while you're here, let me know."

reminder  "Hadn't you better start back with that ring?"

reward  qJaqqarsRing
