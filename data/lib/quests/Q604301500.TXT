name  "Ancient Bone Dagger"
type  fedex

proposal  "Remember this, a dull dagger is a double danger.  It's a danger to you.  For one thing, a dull dagger is no kind of protection, and for the second, a dull dagger can give you careless habits in handling daggers, habits that will get you sliced if you handle a sharp dagger the same way.  So you've got four words to remember:  keep your daggers sharp.  Now, let's discuss dagger grand-mastery.  I've got a skill book coming for you.  You'll need to go fetch for me an ancient bone dagger that's been found.  Will you do this?" 

declined  "At least remember the four important words."

accepted  "Good.  I heard it was found near Monmouth."

reminder   "Go to Monmouth and ask about an ancient bone dagger."

completed  "A nicely done tool, very nice.  Here's the last skill book you need.  Study diligently."
