proposal  "I've got it right here, and I'll make you a deal for it.  Did you know it has a white pig on it?

Would you do me a favor to get it?"

accepted  "I would like to have an Amulet of Finvarra that has turned up in Silverbrook."

reminder   "Go to Silverbrook and find the Amulet of Finvarra."
