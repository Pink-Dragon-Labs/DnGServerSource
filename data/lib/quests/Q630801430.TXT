name  "Kaliri's Treat"
type  fedex

proposal  "Welcome, dearie.  I've got anything you might want here.  Named m'shop to get folks in.  Is it perhaps a bit of our famous cactus gardens you're wantin'?"

declined  "Well, just look around, then."

accepted  "Happens I have a fine little cactus plant.  Normally old Kaliri would sell it to you, but I wonder if you'd run an errand for me in exchange.  If you would just run over to Fantastic Meals and fetch a treat for me.  Sanria, such a dear child, knows I've got a sweet tooth.  You just bring it to me and the cactus is yours."

reminder  "Sanria runs Fantastic Meals.  She has a treat ready for me."

completed  "Now look at you.  Back already with a treat for old Kaliri.  Thank'ee kindly.  And here's that bit of cactus I promised you."
