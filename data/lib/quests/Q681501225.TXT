name  "Beef Jerky"
type  fedex

proposal  "It do beat all the interest some folk have in bits and pieces of old things.  No use to be got out of 'em that I kin see.  Business is business, though.  It be true an old pot shard from Drune dwells on the shelf yonder, but danged if I know how folk hear of it.  Let's get down to it.  I've been hankering for a slab of beef jerky.   Would ye see yer way clear to fetch me some so as to acquire the old bit of crockery yer heart yearns after?"

declined  "Couldn't be a fairer deal."

accepted  "Be off, then, to Caer Fandry.  I don't hold with elves as a general rule, but by golly, they make a fine bit of jerky."

reminder   "Beef jerky from Caer Fandry will get ye the broken bit of pot."

completed  "Dang me if ye didn't carry through.  Here be the broken pot, then.  Come again.  I be expectin' more smashed bits."
