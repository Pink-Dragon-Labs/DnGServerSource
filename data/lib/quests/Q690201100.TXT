name  "Giant Gnat's Ear"
type  fedex

proposal   "My name is Nassoula.  I am skilled in Mysticism and can guide you from Familiar skills all the way to become a Grand Master of Mysticism.  If you wish to become an apprentice, we will begin at once.  Is it your desire to learn the spells of Mysticism?"

declined  "Very well."

accepted   "Very well.  You will begin studies at the level of Familiar Mystic Spells.  First, however, it will be necessary for you to do a small service for me.  I wish to receive a Giant Gnat's Ear, long extinct. When you return victoriously from this quest I will issue the first book of spells.  It is advisable to begin in Caer Fandry."
 
reminder   "Do not dawdle.  Go to Caer Fandry and seek out a Giant Gnat's Ear."

completed  "This is an adequate result for your first quest.   Take, then, this spell book and learn it.  Return when you are ready to proceed to the next level."
