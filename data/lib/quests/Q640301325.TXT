name  "Jellied Berries of Usk"
type  fedex

proposal  "Nemor the Noble was a proud man, so proud that he bestowed the title of Noble on himself, or so the story goes.  I wouldn't know for sure.  I've lived here in Wen all my life, and never traveled anywhere else.  At any rate, what you're wanting is the amulet.   Normally I couldn't help, but it just so happens that a customer left that amulet here with me.  He wanted my brew, but he was short of funds.  I traded for the amulet thinking it might come in handy some day, and look what happened.  You walked in.  I have something you want, and you could do something I want.  What about a little trade, stranger?

declined  "Fine, fine."

accepted  "I don't travel myself, but I have a hankering for some of the Jellied Berries of Usk.  I had a taste once, and have always wanted more.  Get me some, stranger, and the amulet is yours."

reminder   "Jellied Berries of Usk, stranger."

completed  "My mouth is watering at the sight.  Thanks and here's the amulet."
