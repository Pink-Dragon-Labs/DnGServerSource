name  "A Braided Leather Belt"
type  fedex

proposal  "Well, now.  Ready for grand-mastery of the axe.  That's good to hear, very good.  I'm always glad to see a warrior value the axe.  It's a good weapon, and vastly underrated by many.  I'll ask you to see if you can locate a braided leather belt.  I had a teacher once who used a braided belt, very unusual it was.  I'm wondering if this could be the very one.  It would be a pleasure to me to have it.  A traveler through here mentioned casually seeing one in Arimathor. It didn't occur to me until he traveled on that it might be the same.  Would you try to find it?"

declined  "Keep it in mind, then."

accepted  "Good.  I'll wish you luck."

reminder   "Look for a braided leather belt in Arimathor."

completed  "The very one! I do believe it's the very belt I remember!  My thanks, and here's the last skill book you need."
