name  "Andrea's Lunch"
type  fedex

proposal  "I've got them.  They were found on the street in front, and I recognized them.  Stolen from the order somehow.  Crime in our streets is out of control, way out of control.  There's no safe place.  I don't even want to venture out.  In fact, if you'll pick up my lunch in exchange for the shoes then I won't have to go out.  Will you."

declined  "You're going out anyway, aren't you?"

accepted  "That's a relief."

reminder   "Go get my lunch and I'll give you Liuja's boots."

completed  "Thank you.  I would be happy if I never had to go out in the streets again."
