proposal  "A magic rock of Kurz?  So you come to my tavern.  What makes you think there is a magic rock of Kurz?  What makes you think it's in my tavern?  What makes you think you can walk in here and carry off a magic rock?  No answers, huh.  Thought not.  I should just throw you out.  Ha.  Well, you've got guts, stranger.  I like that.  Some people just run right out when I start in on them.  Funny sight.  But you didn't so I'll tell you what I'm going to do.  I'm going to give you this rock.  No guarantees understand.  I don't know that it's anything but a rock.  I was told it was more, but I'm not ready to believe that.  Great Mabon, if I believed that, I'd keep the danged rock.  But I'm going to give it to you.  What do you say about that, stranger?  Do you want this rock?"

declined  "Probably not worth the bother."

accepted  "Then take it.  But don't tell anybody where you got it."

reward   qMagicRock
