proposal  "For the proprietor of Sand and Roses, yes.  Stripe are tasty, and when smoked absolutely delicious! If you haven't tasted them, you haven't lived!  I did not want to package his order until the transport arrived (you don't mind if I call you transport, do you?) because it keeps them in the best condition.  Would you do me a quick little favor while I prepare them? Fenia has some flower seed for me.  She's my cousin, and she grows the most beautiful flowers!  Will you go fetch my seed?"

declined  "Never mind."

accepted  "Fenia has it in her shop.  She's the Monmouth healer."

reminder   "Fenia has some flower seed for me."
