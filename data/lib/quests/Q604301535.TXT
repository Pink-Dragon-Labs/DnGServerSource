proposal  "I believe I do have what you want, friend. Wen is such a quiet and peaceful town that I don't have an overload of wounded patients. I had free time so I took up dabbling in painting as a hobby.  That led me to experimenting with mixing the colors, and I came up with a very nice shade of reddish paint.  I'll be glad to let you have a tube in exchange for a favor I need.  I would like some small clay pots from Silverbrook.  Will you do this errand?"

declined  "That's fine, friend."

accepted  "Excellent. I'll look forward to your return."

reminder   "You're going to seek for some small clay pots in Silverbrook."

completed  "Very nice selection.  Thank you.  Here is the tube of red paint I promised you."
