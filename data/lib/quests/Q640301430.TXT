name  "Wool Skeins for Alysa"
type  fedex

proposal  "I'm so glad.  She's going to be wild when she sees this pattern.  She'll be up all night setting up her materials.  I told her to lay in a good supply of colored wool.  I hope she took me seriously.  There is one shade I wanted to send for her birthday, but it needs to be picked up in Usk.  Would you go get it?  Please say you will.  Will you?" 

declined  "It is a lot to ask, I guess."

accepted  "Great.  A giantess in Usk has a marvelous new shade of rose wool.  She's holding several skeins for me."

reminder   "Go to Usk for the wool skeins I want."

completed  "What a beautiful color!  Let me just tuck one skein in with the pattern for Deanna."
