proposal  "That's what I like about being in business.  Supply and demand.  I was just offered a supply of wasp's wings, so I took them with the idea that there would be demand.  And here you are, demanding, so to speak.   Barter is a way of life here, and this is my offer.  I'll give you the very best of all these wasp wings if you will make a journey to Monmouth for me.  Will you?"

declined  "It's your choice."

accepted  "A busy shopkeeper can't just travel across the Realm at will.  I've got an order of smoked stripe waiting for me in Monmouth."

reminder   "Go to Monmouth and fetch my order of smoked stripe."

completed  "I've been hungering for a taste of this.  It's well worth one of these wasp wings."
