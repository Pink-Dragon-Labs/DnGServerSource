proposal  "Happens I do.  Not in Monmouth, though.  Ye got a bum steer from someone there.  But old Geezer kin set you straight.  I'll tell ye what I know, and I'll give it to ye in writin' lest ye forget.  But first, how about lookin' in on me old friend, Brindal, over at his establishment and bringing me a drop to slake me thirst.   Can't leave me shop, but I could sure do with a drop of ale.  Will ye do it?"
