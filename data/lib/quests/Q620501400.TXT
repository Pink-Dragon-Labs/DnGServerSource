proposal  "Thaumaturgy Master skills are not easy, not easy at all.  However, I can assist you.  Not many are able, but I, Xolina, can do this.  First, however, you must find for me a Banshee Relic.  One has turned up in Kurz, I hear.  Will you undertake this?"

declined  "I see.  Not up to it."

accepted  "I do not know if this Banshee Relic will be difficult to find.  Kurz is a town of cut throats, but they will deal in almost anything, I am told."

reminder   "I require a Banshee Relic.  Seek first in Kurz."

completed  "Well, I am impressed.  Accept this spellbook for Thaumaturgy Master spells."
