type  fedex

proposal  "News certainly travels fast.  It wasn't that long ago that I discovered it.  Did you hear the story?  I was in a great hurry, which usually brings me to no good, I must admit.  I tripped myself up, dropped all my packages, and they went every which way.  I was busy moaning over my banged-up knee, which still hurts, when suddenly I hear a lot of popping.  Well, now, I nearly jumped out of my elf-skin, I assure you.  When I looked around white puffs were flying everywhere to the sound of popping.  Yipes, is what I thought to myself.  I limped over to the fire to see what was popping and it was the corn!  Well, I forgot all about my knee, at least for while.  I picked one up and decided to taste it, which I've been scolded for as a questionable practice since it could have poisoned me, but taste it I did, and I'm glad.   And now you're here for some of my popping corn.  Would you be a good chappie and go to our healer for some ointment for my knee?  I'll give you the corn if you'll only do this for me.  Will you?"  

declined  "My poor knee will never be the same."

accepted  "Enid will bless you for your kind actions, friend."

reminder   "My poor knee.  You were going to fetch some ointment from the healer for me."

completed  "You're a kind person, you are.  Take the popping corn.  Tell people about it, too."
