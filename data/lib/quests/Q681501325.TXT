proposal  "You'll be from Meta, then.  I sent word when I found it because I knew she would want it.  She returns the favor by watching for fossils in the desert for me.  I need a favor from you, though.  Before I give you the stone, I need you to go to Monmouth and get a supply of black mushrooms.  These aren't for healing, by the way.  I want the edible kind.  My whole family enjoys them, and I want a supply for a celebration we have scheduled.  What about it?"    

declined  "Perhaps I'll go myself."

accepted  "Good.  Monmouth always has a good supply.  You should be able to find some."

reminder   "Go to Monmouth and find some black mushrooms."

completed  "Excellent.  My thanks.  I've packed the stone for Meta."
