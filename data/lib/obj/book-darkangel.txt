"The Dark Angel Awakens"
by Aelig


A calm wind passed through the temple of the damned.  Harsh screams of the dead spirits filled the halls.  Since the invasion had begun, the goddess was ever so diligent judging the souls of warriors whom had the unfortunate fate of crossing paths with a mist invader.  The forces of the mist had expanded their borders very close to the temple of Elphame.  

As the night proceeded, a lone Dolus Thrall had stumbled into the temple.  The screeching of the spirits had alarmed it at first, but with a grunt, the Minotaur continued to venture deeper into the temple.  It peered around the corner and saw the statue of the goddess of death.  Recognizing the statue, the creature let out a small grumble when it realized that the temple was unguarded.  Slamming its axe on the ground in bliss, it approached the statue with malicious intentions.  
The Minotaur stared deep into the eyes of the statue before raising it’s axe high in the air, ready to crumble the sculpture into rubble.  As it started to drive the heavy axe down, the statue’s eyes sparkled a deep red color, and the ground began to shake violently.  It was too much force for the Dolus Thrall to handle and it was thrown to the ground.  The floor in front of the statue started to split and crack open.  Flames spewed up from the depths of within the hole.  Crawling back, and frantically searching for its axe, the creature let out a loud howling noise in hopes someone would hear, but it was all in vain.  

The flames had suddenly stopped.  A voice spoke out, solemn yet resilient, and said “Arise my dark angel.”  Emerging in front of the creature was a black figure with wings that shimmered in the night.  The spirits of the underworld circled the being as it continued to ascend above the ground.  In his left hand was a blood red sword which discharged flames from its blade.  The figure slowly opened his eyes and stared down the Minotaur.  He brought his sword up so the tip pointed straight between the creature’s eyes and spoke softly. 

“You have been judged, and your sentence is death.”  As he spoke that, he raised his sword and struck once with a downward motion.  The Dolus Thrall was engulfed with the flames of the underworld.  The screeching spirits within the temple became visible and passed through the Minotaur, filling the creature’s mind with feelings of pain and agony, just as the spirits had felt before their death.  The creature stumbled around grasping its head, feeling the pain of every soul that passed through the temple.  The flames had begun to emerge from the hole once again as the creature stumbled towards it, not knowing that it was there.  The dark figure let a smile cross his face as he watched the blazing creature fall into the depths of the underworld.  

The flames calmed, and the floor of the temple was returned to its original state as the winged figure gracefully landed.  He kneeled before the statue and placed his sword on the ground.  His eyes started glowing a bright red color and spoke to his goddess.
“I have awakened, and the fire still burns within.”
