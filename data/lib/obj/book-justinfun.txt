"Just in Fun"
by Faewynd


My sister (a barbarian) and I (a cunning thief) 
were sitting at the Gnarled Leg (both seeking some relief).
A long and bloody battle we had recently won, 
so we kicked back and chugged an ale, anticipating fun.
 
Suddenly a cloud of smoke from near the doorway sprang 
a flash of light, a crackling sound and then there was this man.
A small and puny human male, completely dressed in grey.
He glanced around but made no sound (it seemed he'd lost his way)
 
Saint elbowed me & gave a wink then said "At last some fun!"
I knew this "newb" would need a prayer before this night was done.
She stood up tall and menacing, an awesome sight beheld.
Hair flaming red, near 6 foot 3, she spoke to him, he yelled.
 
"You seem lost my little friend."(A kindly soul she ain't)
"Come take my hand and join our band, and try hun, not to faint."
I smirked behind my foamy ale to see him squirm and shake.
She nearly picked him off the floor as if he were a snake.
 
"May I present my sister, a little thing its true" 
"But do be warned, she has a sting, and Spyder's aim will do."
I stood up by my sister’s side and kicked her in the knee.
Her touching introduction was REAL heartfelt I could see.
 
The trembling stranger stopped a sec & tried to draw a breath. 
The fright that shined from out his eyes showed that he feared his death.
At last he stammered out some words... "Orion is my name"
and then he asked exactly how he came into this game.
 
His knees were knocking as he sat, I handed him an ale
and as he sipped the pungent grog, we girls began our tale.
We told him in the hours late of monsters fierce and gruesome.
The land was overrun with cows? And wizards? Yes, we knew some.
 
We tried our best all through the night to scare this man away.
To send him running to his bed, and yet he meant to stay.
By mornings light we two were tired and mellowed by the brew.
We felt at last that he should pass, and formed a friendship true.
 
That was many years ago, with battles won and lost
Monies found, then whittled down, but not at friendships cost
For now its three that stand & face the monsters of this land
Spyder, Saint, & MorningStar, a tight knit little band.
 
We found that night the real reward of everything we do
is finding in each others hearts, a true friend, just like you.
