"The Letter"
by ShadowedPrincess


No one in the town was allowed to speak her name... many of the children never even learned what it was.   The girl was a princess, though few of the villagers knew it.  She lived with her father the king, her brother who was heir to the throne, and her cousin who was the only survivor of the dragon Sidmarin.  The family was a kind and understanding one, not only to each other, but to their followers.

The village loved their king, and his son.  They were good men.  The princess however, was frowned upon by her father.  She spent all her days down in the village teaching the poor children, or helping farmers with their crop.  She often came home dirty and long after dark, but she was a happy woman.   

The prince knew all of his sister’s secrets.  How she had not truly lost her most expensive dinner dress; that she’d given it to a poor family with a talented child to pay for schooling.  How she had been learning how to hunt and mend armor and clothing as payment for her services from the villagers. But her brother loved her, and he kept her secrets, though sometimes he, along with his father, felt that she belonged in the castle, and should act more like a lady. 

The prince and the princess did not tell their cousin their secrets.  Their cousin was a very private man.  He often spent time with the king speaking in whispers and looking around cautiously.  But he was their cousin, and they thought nothing of it because he was family.  Privately, the cousin was becoming increasingly jealous of the prince because he was heir to the throne.  He felt the prince was weak, and gave in too easily to the whims of the princess.   

The cousin made a plan to take the throne.  He whispered lies and half truths to the king about the prince being distressed and imbalanced because of the princess’ romps with villagers.  He told the prince that his father was ill, and could not be disturbed, putting a rift between them.  The king saw the prince spending more and more time away from him, and he became worried for the prince’s well being.  He had guards placed inside the castle halls at all times to keep watch over the prince.   

Not long later, the princess was yet again returning late at night.  She knew the guards were in the castle, and would report her to her father, so she snuck in through her window.  Once she was inside, she walked across the hall to tell her brother that she’d returned safely, but he was not in his bed as he should have been... in fact, he was not in his room at all.  His bed was disheveled, and his room was a mess, not even the curtains were hanging properly.  She knew something was terribly wrong.   

As she felt the tears start falling down her cheeks, she moved the sheets on the bed to make a place for her to sit and she saw blood on the mattress.  She jumped off the bed onto the marble floor and her foot slipped on something... Sobbing, she looked down to see what it could have been and she noticed, slightly under the bed, a letter.  She picked it up, opened it and began to read... it was a note from her brother.  It said one word... their cousin’s name.   She knew it meant many things... her brother was alive, and that their cousin, their very own blood, had something to do with her brother’s disappearance. 

She stood up, and opened her mouth to call to the guards, when her cousin walked through the door and saw her standing with the note.  He immediately screamed for the guards, who came rushing in seconds later to see the princess in the middle of the scene.

She began telling them what she’d found, but her cousin had already put his plan into action.  He screamed at the guards to take her away.  The princess saw no other option, she had to flee... she had to find her brother and bring him back to tell them of her innocence, and she had to protect her brother from their cousin. 

The princess leapt out the window and raced to the barn.  She jumped on their fastest horse and rode into the village with no sight of the guards behind her.  Once she reached the town, everywhere she went there were murmurings of the prince’s swift exit from their lands.  No one understood why he’d left in such a hurry.  The princess knew better than to inform them, for surely this information would hasten their deaths.  

The princess followed the rumors and stories of her brother’s race through their lands through the south.  She came to a small town called Caer Fandry; the first land outside her father’s rule.  The elves seemed very reluctant to share any information with a princess from so far away.  

The towns in this new kingdom had strange gods who were at war with each other.  She passed through a burning city called Leinster, helping villagers remove items from their shops and homes.   She stayed in Leinster, even when the burning was done, and the gods were at peace.  She helped plant and make plans for 2 new cities to replace the one split in half.  Everywhere she went, she heard rumors of her brother, but every time she reached the next town, he had moved on.   

The princess did not stay anywhere very long; she knew her brother would move on very quickly.  She finally reached the borders of this new Realm at a town named Murias, and the stories of her brother were only days old... she was catching up.  However, when the day came to exit the kingdom, a mist moved onto the grounds.  She tried to go around the mists, but after months of searching for an exit, she learned she had none.  She was trapped in this new land...

Having lost her brother, her homeland, and her friends, the princess settled in a town named Drune.  To this very day she remains there, still searching for her brother, swearing vengeance on her cousin.  She has learned all there is to learn about her new surroundings; she is no longer the novice she once was.  She stays to herself, but if you are ever in need and she crosses your path, you just might receive the aide you have prayed to the gods about... Shadowed though she may be, she is still a kindly princess at heart.
