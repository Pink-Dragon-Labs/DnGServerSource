1st Entry – Entering the Mist
I’ve finally done it; I found a way into the mist.  I can only hope that this path stays open long enough for me to elude those creatures and to find help for Drune.  There is no going back now anyway...

2nd Entry – Third Day in the Mist
I fear I may truly be lost.  The Mist opens before me, but just as quickly closes behind as if to guide me in a specific direction.  At least none of those horrific creatures have found me yet.

3rd Entry – Fifth Day in the Mist
My provisions are running low and I can’t find anything edible in this blasted fog.  I am beginning to feel that the gods have decided to make sport of my plight.  I hope Drune has been able to hold off the Invaders.  I thought I heard something following me, not unlike a Fenris but this was even quieter, barely audible to my elven ears.  I swear this mist has eyes.

4th Entry – Eighth Day in the Mist
Today the mist parted to reveal a temple.  My rations have been almost nothing so I had hoped that there would be Clerics to offer shelter and food.  Unfortunately I was wrong, the temple appears to have been abandoned long ago but some of the statues and writings seem familiar.  As I tried to leave the area, the mist pushed me back.  It would seem that I am supposed to stay here for some purpose.

5th Entry – Tenth Day in the Mist
The last of my supplies was used this morning and still I am no closure to escape or salvation.  Why did I ever leave Drune?  I should have gone to Silverbrook... At least I think I’ve figured out what the statues were.  If I am not mistaken, the temple I am at is one for the deities of the invaders!  And the writing appears an ancient form of our own.  I am only partly able to translate a shattered tablet I found near the statue of their god.  It reads: “To the soul who finds this place, ever after you shall be (unable to translate) until the land is reclaimed by the mist!”  Could this be the reason for the invasion of the Realm?  What was that?

6th Entry – Eleventh Day in the Mist
I pray to the gods that I am able to be free of this accursed mist.  I was attacked yesterday by something that could only be described as pure evil.  I think it would make a Lich cower in fear.  I was frozen in place as it slowly crept closer, my sword still in its sheath because I could not draw it.  Suddenly the mist moved... yes MOVED in and swallowed the creature.  I could hear its screams as life was slowly drained from it.  Once it was dead, the mist retreated back to the original boundaries leaving me the corpse for food, I think...

7th Entry – Thirteenth Day in the Mist
I’ve survived several days on the meat provided by that creature.  It is almost bittersweet.  Strange to think something so terrifying could taste so good.  I’ve been able to finish the translation on the tablet and the missing word appears to be “cursed as beast”.  I have finished a thorough search of the ruins and nothing else is legible enough to translate.  It almost looks that the temple was destroyed from the inside, as if it were holding something back that broke free.  I am still unable to leave this clearing... what more could there be for me here?

8th Entry – Fifteenth Day in the Mist
I’ve abandoned all hope of leaving these ruins.  I can only assume the gods have placed me here for a purpose or some evil sport.  The howling is growing louder at night, as if hundreds, no thousands, of those beasts are running on either side of me... When will the gods deliver me from this evil abode?

9th Entry – Seventeenth Day in the Mist
They know I am here and they like it none at all... I swear that the gods have forsaken me, leaving me to the mercy of the invaders and their demigods.  I no longer care about the Realm.  This place, it is corrupting me... I can feel it in my bones.  I pray, whoever finds this journal take this message to your people... They are never going to stop coming for you, we are all lost...

10th Entry – Twentieth Day in the Mist
I can no longer see the temple.  The mist has swallowed it whole... The howling of the creatures has finally stopped but I will not survive another day without food and water.  I can hear a stream in the distance but I can not tell from where it comes... If anyone finds this, then I am truly gone and the Realm is forever lost from my sight... My gods have not answered my prayers for mercy, maybe the invader’s gods will answer my prayer for death...

Note from Finder of the Journal -
This journal was found floating in a stream near the town of Drune, blood covering the last pages.  It is hoped that the adventurer made it to freedom, but none have come forward to claim it as their own and none can recall the attack on the town of Drune mentioned in its pages so we can only believe that the author is long dead.  May the gods grant him peace...
