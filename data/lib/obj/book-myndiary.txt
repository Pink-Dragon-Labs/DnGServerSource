"Myn's Diary"

As the first rays of sunlight gleamed off the wet rooftops on yet another crisp fresh morning, a songbird began his dawn chorus.  Alive with the moment that he engaged, his song could be heard through out the town.  To me this day was to be the start of a new way of life.  I had decided late last night after many sleepless hours, to leave the comforts of home and venture out into the Realm.  Mother had said it was unsafe in the Realm, and had been, for many years.  She had kept me cooped up in a small town called East Leinster after father had died in the Great War.  Pretty as it was and filled with many admirable characters that frequented the local merchant shops, I was beginning to feel trapped.  I desired exploration, adventure, and to know for myself what lay outside the walls.  I had heard many wild stories, and now needed to see for myself what treasures could be found.
 
So this very morning, shortly after breakfast (as it a well know fact that no adventurer missed breakfast) I went to Ebony Crystal with what money I had saved and the basic clothes on my back.  I was more than ready, I had been trained proficiently in the use of a two handed sword at the local training academy, the School of Hard Knocks in West Leinster.  I felt prepared to venture out on my first escapade.  After buying some healing potions and provisions of food for my trip, I stood in the store for a moment checking to make sure I had everything.  As luck would have it an old family friend entered the store, one whom my mother blames for my wild adventurous side.  He had filled my head with such wondrous stories of daemons and cyclops that my dreams were overflowing with images of heroic battles, bloodshed and riches. He looked at me curiously as I grinned, “And what plans have you today my dear?” he bellowed. I stared up at him and said, “Oh I was just umm” 

He smiled, and said, I think it's time.  Don't you?  He rummaged about in his belongings then passed me a backpack and a large sheathed sword. “Just don’t tell your mother who gave it to you,” he smiled showing his teeth.  “Best be off, stuff to do.”  Then in a whirl of smoke and a whoosh of sound he was gone.  

Unfortunately for my friend, his smiles always looked more like a snarl, but that was not his fault.  It was just in his bloodline to look so monstrous.  Once you got to know him you tended not to notice the protruding teeth, broken looking nose, sunken eyes and that musky unwashed aroma that seemed to linger about him.  

The backpack was heavy, I could hardly lift it.  I struggled to get it outside.  On the way threw the door, I knocked into a young man, who glared at me with the most vibrant blue eyes. He was short even for an elf his general features delicate and slender his clothes elegant and immaculate.  He had a way about him that seemed nimble and graceful; every move he made seemed to happen in an instant.  In comparison, my actions seemed so slothful and clumsy.  He was in a hurry.

“Sorry,” I stuttered. 

He paused, then shook is head dismissively, “It is I who should not be in such haste,” he said swiftly.  “Have you seen anyone about who looks like they can handle a sword?" he looked me up and down intently, and then said, “Oh never mind,” and hastened off.  

Left bemused by the encounter, I went and sat on a stool out in front of the store.  I looked into the backpack.  I found a beautifully crafted chain mail vest made from a light, tough metal.  I had seen this type on many of the toughest warriors, it fitted well.  Underneath the vest there was a small package, I dismissed it for now, turned, and unsheathed the huge sword.  It was made of a luscious blue metal- admantium, I believed they called it.  I slid my hand a long the smooth cold blade.  A mouse ran past squeaking, and while distracted I accidentally caught the edge.  From the slightest touch blood wept from my fingers the wound began to sting.  It made me feel a little lightheaded.  This blade was indeed sharp! 

Remembering the package, I opened it, hoping to find dressings and ointment.  Instead there was a coiled up old shabby belt with a gold crafted buckle that was in need of a good buff.  There were also two rings; one was plain silver with an inscription upon it, the other gold with a blood red gem set into it.  As I looked through my own supplies for a bandage to wrap roughly around my wounded fingers, I realized the stinging had stopped.  Curiously I looked, wiping away the drying blood from where the gash had been.  I was surprised to see it had healed.  There was a faint reddish mark that remained and as I watched it faded to nothing.  Strange I thought, maybe this armor has more to it than I first thought.  More rapidly I put on the belt and rings.  As I stood up, I fitted the sword into its sheath.  I felt different; somehow everything seemed lighter and I felt stronger.  The sword didn’t seem a burden to me.  I was ready.

I walked past the Ivory Moon Cafe.  There were several people about, they were talking and drinking.  I smiled at the thought of what adventures I was to have and how I too could be seated there very soon telling my tales of monsters and of how I had recovered such marvelous treasure.  I slowed as I approached the walls they were tall, thick, and made of a dark cold stone.  There were several openings in the walls around Leinster.  It was believed a magical aura prevented the occupants of the wilds from entering.  

Taking a deep breath, I stepped out into the woodland.  There was a narrow path of shingle and dense trees on either side.  It seemed dark and there was a strange feel to the air about me. As I walked along the path, a large bat swooped down towards me its craws sharp and teeth bore.  Surprised, I tried to raise my sword, but it was still sheathed!  I struggled with the sword to free it and tried to dodge the bat as it flew at me.  Its claws gashed my arm, blood ran freely from the wound and I felt faint.  I just managed to free my sword as it attacked me again.   I swung wildly at the creature, it screeched as the blade sank deeply into it fresh.  Looking onto the ground I saw the lifeless carcass of the bat; it was hardly recognizable.  I staggered and swayed, I was finding it difficult to stand.  I collapsed against a tree trunk breathing heavily.  My vision was blurred.  I wiped my forehead was it sweat?  No, it had managed to claw my face. My hand was stained with blood, I couldn’t move.  Feeling delirious I tried to stand and crumpled back to the ground.  I lay there thinking I would rest until the armor could heal me.  

Laying there in the darkness of the woods, I could hear on angelic melody playing in my head.  Then I saw a shimmering light coming from the trees.  I strained to focus.  There in the darkness was an illuminated image of a small girl.  Her tiny form was so perfect with delicate wings.  She floated on the very breeze so effortlessly; as if her body was light itself. I thought I was dreaming as she fluttered closer towards me.  The music I could hear came form her, she was singing.  The words I could make out I did not understand.  As her song washed over my mortal soul I felt my breathing become effortlessness again and the pain of my injuries relieved.  Her smile was beatific, as she hovered in front of me momentarily, then she was gone. Relieved to be alive, I got up slowly and gathered myself.  Sighing deeply, I smiled, it had been my first fight to the death and I had survived.  It was no daemon to speak of, but it was a beginning.
