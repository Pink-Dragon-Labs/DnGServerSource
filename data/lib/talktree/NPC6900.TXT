topic "Tell me about Asgard."
        text "Certainly. In Asgard, as in nature, it is survival of the fittest. If you crave order, you should visit towns like Arimathor and Cambria."
        text "Other towns impose unnatural restrictions on people. Asgarders believe that those restrictions are yokes under which only cowards can live."
        text "Asgarders revere strength, bravery, ferocity, and ruthlessness in battle. Still, we love and encourage beauty, truth, and knowledge. We do not, however, appreciate excessive curiosity."

topic "Who are you?"
        text "I am Faldora, current proprietor of the Pig and Kettle. My mother was proprietor before me, and her mother before her, and so on and on into the mists."
        text "The Pig and Kettle has the reputation of being a lively place, and that's just the way I like it. The other taverns in town are dull, lifeless places where nothing ever happens."
        text "Make your needs known, stranger.  I don't wish to spend all day standing here talking to you."

topic "Can I do something for you?"
        text "It would be well if you curbed your curiosity. And perhaps not continue asking questions."
