banner "Hello. I am Eldrin, owner and operator of the Swap-N-Shop. Look over what I have to offer you, and I think you will find a few things you need for your home."

topic "Tell me about the Swap-N-Shop."
	text  "Well, I am a resident here in West Leinster, and my good friend and business neighbor Skon told me of this building for rent."
	text  "I immediately jumped on the opportunity and opened up the Swap-N-Shop here, a one of a kind specialty store in the land."
	text  "The items I sell here can be used to decorate your house. You can pick them up and drop them as you please in your own home."
	text  "You will not be able to drop them outside of your home, and you cannot pick these items up from another persons home, either."
	text  "There is also a bit of magic surrounding the items, which prevents you from losing them if you die."
end

topic "Tell me about Coppers."
	text  "Coppers are the currency I deal in. Your gold is of no use in my shop."
	text  "The Realm's Event Staff would be the ones that award coppers to adventurers like yourself."
	text  "You may spend your coppers here at my store, but do not expect to be able to get them back. All sales at the Swap-N-Shop are final; there are no refunds."
end

topic "Have you heard any interesting rumors?"
	text  "I don't know that they're rumors, but I've heard fascinating things about other towns in the Realm."
	text  "I heard that inhabitants of Asgard are very courageous, but very warlike as well."
	text  "I have not left West Leinster very often, except to take strolls to the park in West Havenwood."
end

topic "Can I do anything for you?"
        text "Yes, go win some coppers and bring them back here - I will be happy to take them from your hands in trade for a lovely piece of furniture."
