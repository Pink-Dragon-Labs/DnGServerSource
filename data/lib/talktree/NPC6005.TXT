topic "Tell me about West Leinster."
        text "The history of Leinster is a tragic one, my friend. At one time, Leinster was under the protection of Despothes, King of the gods."
        text "Then Despothes and Duach fought and, in a fit of rage, Duach did smite Leinster, dividing it in twain."
        text "For a long time Leinster was divided into two sections, with ruins separating us from our brethren."
        text "But with the coming of the hordes from the Mists, the gods made peace with one another and healed our shattered village with glorious new gardens."
	text  "My family roots go back to the beginnings of Leinster.  Skon's a name that's been in each generation of our family since, in an unbroken line.  It's an honor to bear the name."
	text  "Leinster was but a small village in those early days but it grew to be the largest and most magnificent town in the Realm."
