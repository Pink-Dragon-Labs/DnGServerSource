        text "So you'd like to know of our town, eh? Certainly, certainly. Drune's history begins deep in the forest, for that is the origin of all elves. When the world was young, elves lived in peace and worshipped Enid. Though our nature is peaceful, we also love our solitude."
        text "Enid persuaded our forebears to form a village where they could work together for the common good, as once they had worked together to drive the orcs from the forest. Enid's words were wise, and so our ancestors formed Drune here at the edge of the forest."
