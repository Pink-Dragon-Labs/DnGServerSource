topic "Tell me about yourself?"
	text "I have traveled far with my two brothers, Sion & Sinclair.   I have toiled mightily to get this place cleaned up, in preparation for my new shop.  But I am delighted to be here.  The people here are friendly, happy and so helpful in carting away the rubbish piles for me.  Anyhow, I have dreams of getting my permanent shop up and running, but until then all I can offer is my dyes.  I hope that my styling talents will be useful to all when I get my shop."
