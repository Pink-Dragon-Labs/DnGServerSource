topic "Tell me about Asgard."
        text "Certainly, Friend. Asgard is an ancient town, established in The Realm since before time's counting. Asgard is famed for its beauty and culture."
        text "Northmen invaded the region in waves over hundreds of years, affecting our culture and beliefs. Eventually, however, the invaders could not overpower the race their fathers had fathered."
        text "When several of the invading armadas in the heat of battle were sunk by blood-soaked Asgarders, the Northmen gave up on Asgard as a source of plunder. Ha!"
