        text "Did my sister send you, I wonder?  She runs Fantastic Togs next door.  We are twins, she and I.  Janria will not speak of such things, but I do not fear."
	text "Giants are large, it is true, and sometimes even intelligent.  But it is reported they cannot see in the dark.  Not like us.  Ha! We of Arimathor see at night as well as day.  There!"
	text "Elves are nearly as strong as giants.  Did you know that?  It's true.  Sounds odd though, doesn't it?"
	text "They say there is a town where many rogues live.  Yes, it is true.  And it is said there is a maze in the sewers!  But I don't know. Why one would want to wander the sewers?  This talk of a maze is blather I should think."
