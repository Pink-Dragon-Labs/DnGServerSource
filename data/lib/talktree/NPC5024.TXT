	topic "The Diaspora"
		text "Six gods rule the land of The Realm, two by two by two; Duach and Elphame, Despothes and Finvarra, and Enid and Mabon. Although Despothes rules, it is often whispered that all gods cast covetous eyes upon the throne."
	end
	topic "Duach"
		text "Duach is the God of Darkness and Evil. He is a jealous God, quick to show his wrath, and vengeful beyond comprehension. Many times in the past has his anger boiled over, his dark fist sweeping across the land, despair and affliction washing over everything in its wake. Once, in a jealous rage, he even smote the Village of Leinster, burning the center of the most populace village to ashes and sundering the village in twain. It was only by the grace of Enid and intervention by Despothes that the fires were extinguished and the gardens now flourishing in the heart of Leinster began to grow."
	end
	topic "Elphame"
		text "Elphame is the Goddess of Death and Justice. It is she that weighs the value of a mortal life lived and decides the final fate of the departed. Her hunger to judge is known well to scholars and theologians and many point to that, her unappeased yearning for souls, to explain her bond to Duach."

	topic "Despothes"
		text "Despothes is the King of the Gods. He is also known as the God of Balance and the Lord of the Scepter. He is the binding force that maintains the balance of good and evil, ensuring neither dominates the other and that the world remains neutral and free."

	topic "Finvarra"
		text "Finvarra, the God of War, has cast his lot with Despothes and, through that association, has gained substantial power and prestige. This can, perhaps, best be witnessed by comparing his long absence in the hearts of the mortal races with his present high standing by virtue of the weapons and armor of powerful magics he creates in his forge that have entered the lands to aid the people from the threat of the Mists."
	end
	topic "Enid"
		text "Enid is the Goddess of Love and Peace, of Beauty and Nature, and of Compassion and Healing. She is the Lady of Light, the embodiment of all that is good. It was through her blessings that sundered Leinster was healed and the flames of Duach replaced by gardens of unsurpassed beauty. It is she who sends forth the faeries and seraphs to aid the wounded and to protect the forests."

	topic "Mabon"
		text "Mabon is known as the God of Magic. Most of the spells the mortal races use can be attributed to him. Though known as neither a God of Peace, nor a God of War, Mabon has chosen to align himself with Enid and seems to display his Good aspect to the mortal lands for the present. An example of his current beneficence is the mysterious appearance of his temple, long missing and rumored lost within the Mists, upon grounds well known for many ages. How long it shall remain open, or, indeed, whether it will persist in its present locale or disappear again into the Mists is unknown. Perhaps the cryptic puzzles present in the temple, when solved, may provide the answer."

	topic "The Prophet of Despothes"

His manner is, at times, imperial and distant, but he has shown a kind heart and, on rare occasions, a whimsical sense of humor. His language is sometimes difficult for some players but there is great eloquence in how he speaks and, when understood, his messages carry a lot of information. Despothes' chosen village is Asgard. Chosen villages are the places the gods have tasked their followers to defend against the threat that gathers in the mists.

Chosen villages are the places the gods have tasked their followers to defend against the threat that gathers in the mists.

Though with all her wisdom, sometimes her spells do go awry, as shown when she accidentally lost the temple of Mabon in a spell that was meant to protect it. She is naturally kind and inquisitive but it is best to stay on her good side, for she has a small spiteful side which can sometimes rear its ugly head."

Her eyes being marred by seeing constant visions of death. Though from time to time Elita does recall her past life through words or actions.

			text "Ansuz first appeared young and unformed as ZuZu. No hint of her future importance was granted to mortal eyes. The gift of Despothes and protege of the Prophet Herald, the teenage ZuZu was brash, impulsive, and at times even irreverent."
			text "As she developed her potential grew increasingly apparent and she drew the attention of Enid and Duach, both covetous to wield her to their ends."
			text "Thus ensued a mighty struggle between the gods and their temple's followers, each vying to take or hold control over the young ZuZu and thereby threatening her existence itself."
			text "The machinations, plots, and intrigues ended only at the last moment, as ZuZu underwent her transformation into Ansuz, by the gods choosing compromise over destruction and releasing the acolyte from bondage to any path."
			text "Without allegiance to any god, Ansuz's full power is never to be realized. She now walks the lands as an emissary of all the gods, her potential lost but her prestige intact."
			text "During the War with the Mists, Ansuz became ill hearing the voice of the young ZuZu. The citizens were given a choice of saving Ansuz or ZuZu. Not being able to choose one over the other as they had many fond memories of the young ZuZu and had come to love the mature Ansuz intensely, the citizens pleaded with Jasalva to save both."
			text "Jasalva with the help of Milo, performed great magical feats within the halls of Despothes' Temple, separating the two powerful beings from one vessel. Ansuz and ZuZu now walk these lands as sisters aiding the citizens, each in her own special way."

I say most because, rarely, under the guidance of the Gods, The Mists have been pushed back to reveal new territory for mortal exploration and conquest."
	text "The Mists also affect the mystical world that surrounds us and infuses the space, physical and spiritual, in which we reside. This mystical plane is, some have said, the source for many of the magics we have come to know and have likened The Mists to some great hand squeezing, confining, and compressing our existence."

topic "The Infinity Bloom"
	text "This be a story of great confusion and bewilderment for the citizens. The story of the Infinity Bloom and its Creators is related to us by Ansuz through the interpretations of Mabon from a scroll."
	text "It seems that eons ago, when the universe was newly created, before even Luna and the other ancients came into being, there existed three beings known only as the Creators. They were born out of the dust of time. Neither male nor female, they were the ultimate in Light, Dark, and Balance, and they had the daunting task of creating a new universe. Luria was the being of Light and created all things beautiful and bright and loving.  Edros was the source of all Darkness and was Luria's complete opposite, creating all things sinister and shadowed and spiteful.  And Mironid was the being which kept them both in check, making sure that everything that Luria and Edros created was balanced in every way." 	
	text "Mironid never saw the two as being at odds, but as a compliment to one another.  Mironid knew that one could not exist without the other.  When their work was completed, they sat down to discuss which of their creations they loved most.  They focused on a little place that had vast oceans, beautiful mountains, clear flowing streams and rivers, and the most beautiful life forms that Luria had ever created.  Having the most beautiful of creatures meant that it also had the ugliest and vilest of monsters as well."
 	text "In their eyes  ... it was perfect!  They decided that it must have the best of guardians as well.  These new gods would most assuredly take care of their most treasured creation, but to ensure that this happened they devised a plan to place their essences into a creation they called The Infinity Bloom."
 	text "The Infinity Bloom was hand carved from a single perfect diamond.  The diamond was born from a black lump of coal created from the fires that forever burned in Edros' hands.  Seeing the ugly lump of dull, black stone, Luria kissed it and created the diamond, and thus perfect balance was maintained.  Luria then meticulously carved the diamond into a single perfect rose, and in doing so, placed their own good essence into it.  Drained and weary from the arduous task, Luria decided to rest for a while among the stars. They never awoke again."
	text "Seeing an opportunity to gain the upper hand, Edros took the rose in hand and poured the essence of the eternal flames into the rose hoping to blacken or mar it in some way.  However, the center of the rose and then the outer petals began to glow with those fires, taking more than Edros was willing to give.  In the end, also drained and weakened from the assault on the rose, Edros too went to rest among the stars...never to awaken again."
	text "Mironid watched from afar at what his counterparts had done and satisfied that true balance was maintained by Luria's total generosity and Edros' complete selfishness, set out to finish the task.  Mironid decided that should these gods fail in their duties to maintain the balance and perfection of the world the three had created, then the Flower of Destiny would come to life and put things once more in their proper place."
	text "Mironid disguised as a young man, walked the lands in search of a proper place to store the rose. He came upon a small farming village in the land of Sardil.  He met a young farmer and his wife, poor yet generous, who took him in and gave him food and shelter thinking that he was just a lost soul in need of help.  So touched by their actions, he revealed himself and placed the young couple into a life of luxury and immortality." 
	text "He also placed into their hands The Infinity Bloom and told them its true purpose.  Mironid told the young couple that should the day come that their gods fail them, the essences of the Creators would awaken and call out to their descendants.  This could be many years in the future or might never happen at all, but because of the pureness of their souls and their generosity, it was in them that his faith would be placed.  Humbled by Mironid's faith in them, the young couple vowed to pass on their values to their children and to leave a legacy of generosity and understanding of all things.  He told them to always remember that just because something is beautiful and bright, it doesn't mean that there isn't darkness within and that there is great beauty and light even within the darkness."
	text "With confidence that their plan had worked and that The Infinity Bloom had been placed in the right hands, Mironid transferred all his power into The Infinity Bloom, and then transformed into a ball of blinding light and vanished into the endless heavens above to rest along with the other Creators."
	text "It is said that contained in the center of the rose are the fires of destiny and its petals represent all the gifts given to mortal and immortal alike - Power, Faith, Love, Knowledge, Prophecy, Artistry, Beauty, Charity, and Hope.  Whichever of the decedents discover the key to unlocking the powers of the rose will be suffused with all the powers of the Creators.  They will be a being of pure and supreme power over all the world and the universe.  They will be the one to restore order to the chaos and restore the balance between the light and the dark."
