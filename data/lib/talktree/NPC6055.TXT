topic "What are the mystical secrets of magic?"
	text "Well, I don't really know any 'mystical secrets'.  I just use that line to get people interested in my merchandise."
	text "Did it work?"
end

topic "Tell me about Leinster"
	text "I could tell you many things about Leinster."
	text "For instance, I could tell you that Leinster was once the largest and most powerful city in The Realm."
	text "Or I could tell you that Leinster is now a mouse infested ruin because of the terrible smiting it got from Duach."
	text "But I'll keep my mouth shut about such things."
end

topic "Have you heard any interesting rumors?"
	text "Rumors are for sewing circles... I don't speak of rumors..."
	text "... but I did hear that some old guy named Zelbic has a zoo somewhere in the forest called Bloodwood.  Seems his poor father was eaten by a devil.  I doubt if it's true because I know there is no such thing as devils.  Pure garbage, if you ask me!"
end      

topic "Do you have anything for me to do?"
	text "No, I've got nothing at the moment.  Thanks for asking."
