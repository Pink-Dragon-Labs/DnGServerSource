	text  "If I had the leisure, I'd tell you about the time a couple of punks thought they'd help themselves to my stock. I'd have to tell the tale, though, because those two tough guys didn't live to tell it."
	text  "Took care of them myself.  Ha!  They thought an old woman was an easy mark.  They thought wrong!"
