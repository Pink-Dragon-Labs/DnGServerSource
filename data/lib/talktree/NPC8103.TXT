        text "It's my understanding that Usk was founded by giants from Bath who no longer wished to live there."
	text "I gather Bath is a pretty tough town. I'd never go there."
	text "My whole family comes from around here.  I'm the only one who took up a business and settled in, though."
	text "The rest of them are rovers.  I'd say you're roving about the Realm, too, by the looks of you."

topic "Have you heard any interesting rumors?"
        text "Rumors are so insidious. Would you believe I heard that Monji of Excellent Weaponry uses aluminum to forge his weapons, claims they're steel, and charges top price for them."
	text "You should nip that one if you hear it. I know Monji and he would never demean himself like that.  Rumors are disgusting!"

topic "Can I do anything for you?"
        text "If ever you have evidence of whoever is spreading rumors about Monji, tell me. I'd gladly pay for that sort of information."
