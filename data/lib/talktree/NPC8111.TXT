topic	"Who are you?"
	text  "Loyaro is my name.  I'm skilled in the magic of the Realm.  Practice makes perfect is a familiar saying, but in the learning of magic skill it should be a motto."
	text  "I've trained many a magician, and the best are always those who take their craft seriously and who practice.  I can't say it enough--practice!"
end

topic "Have you heard any interesting rumors?"
        text "I've heard some say that the aurora incantata will cast enough magic upon those standing under it that they don’t need my spells."
	text "They are wrong. One needs a potion which will channel the magic."
