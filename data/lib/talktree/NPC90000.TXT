banner "Hail and well met!  What can I do for you?"

topic "Who are you?"
	text "My name is Beral and I own and operate this underground supply store.  I only have one rule about my business... you buy it, not I."
end

topic "Why is your shop way down here?"
	text "I like a bit of privacy in my daily life.  The towns are just getting too crowded for my tastes.  So, I built my shop right here in the ground.  It's cozy all season long and not too far out of the way for everyone."
end

topic "Why don't you sell metal bars and gems anymore?"
	text "Funny you should ask!  I used to sell every material one could think of.  Recently the costs to import these items became too much for a small businessman such as myself.  If it is metal or wood you seek, explore the world.  I used to get my supplies from the Mines.
end

topic "The Mines? You want to know where they are, eh?"
	text "It's my understanding they are in roughly the 4 corners of the world, but I heard a rumor a long time ago that there were not any supplies to be harvested in the deserts.  I heard the mines occasionally produce gems as well, it might be worthy of a young adventurer's time to find them."
