topic "Tell me about Silverbrook."
        text "Silverbrook is a town populated mostly by elves. Silverbrookers live in harmony with nature. We hunt and gather food in the nearby forests."
        text "Until the War of the Continuum, Silverbrook was inhabited by orcs, but upheaval among orcan tribes enabled elven invaders to overrun the village."
	text  "There are some who will tell you that elves have orcan blood admixed.  Don't believe it.  Orc and elf are separate and always have been."

	text  "If you're really that curious, I was born under the sign of the golem. I am single.  I've never been out of Silverbrook, but I'd like to travel someday."
	text  "That's a lot more than you really wanted to know, probably, but you did keep asking."
