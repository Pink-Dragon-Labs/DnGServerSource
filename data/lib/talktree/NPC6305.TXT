        text "So you're not familiar with Monmouth? Well, there is much for you to enjoy. Did you know, for instance, that it never rains in Monmouth?"

topic "Who are you?"
        text "I am Brindal, proprietor of the Eldest Inn.  The original building burned to the ground many years ago, and was rebuilt on the spot."
	text  "My father purchased this tavern from a direct full-blooded descendent of the ancient ones. It is said that the descendents of the ancient ones have mystical powers."
	text  "I don't know about that, but I do know a curious story about the name, Eldest Inn."
	text  "My father thought to change the name when he first purchased it, but after a very strange dream he felt compelled to leave it alone.  He didn't like to talk about that dream, and usually refused to answer questions."
	text "One day he told me a little about it, mainly to impress on me never to change the name."

topic "Can I do something for you?"
        text "You can do nothing for me, Adventurer. At least not today."
